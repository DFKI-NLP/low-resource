{"text": "Haier's 1.0 cu. ft. compact Pulsator Washer provides the convenience of at-home laundry facilities for spaces where full-size machines are not an option. It is ideal for small apartments, mobile homes, and other places where space is limited. This model features a durable stainless steel tub and gives you a choice of Heavy, Normal, or Quick Wash cycles and Low, Medium, or High water levels for the perfect combination every time. The unit plugs into any standard household 120-Volt outlet and connects quickly and easily to any sink. Get the best fit with the included fill and drain hoses and Quick-Connect sink adapter. It also offers optimum portability since it can be easily rolled away for storage. All this plus quiet operation adds up to the ultimate in compact laundry solutions.Small Yet PowerfulThis easy-to-use, compact washer features a durable stainless steel tub and uses a pulsator system rather than a traditional agitator to create a powerful and effective wash action without the twisting and pulling that an agitator can cause. The absence of an agitator also frees up additional space in the wash tub to provide you with maximum wash load capacity. The pulsating action results in superb cleaning performance in a non-abrasive wash environment. It is gentler on clothes as well, making it excellent for items such as cloth diapers, baby clothes, and delicate.Digital ControlsChoose from Heavy, Normal, or Quick Wash cycles and Low, Medium, or High electronically controlled water levels on a simple touch pad to get the perfect combination for your load every time. The electronic controls include a pause button should you need to interrupt the cycle for any reason, and a clear viewing window at the top lets you check on your laundry. LED indicator lights clearly display the cycle status, and an end-of-cycle signal alerts you when clothes are clean and ready to be removed.Easy, No-Fuss InstallationThis compact washer doesn&rsquo;t just fit into small spaces; it connects quickly and easily to any sink. Get the best fit with the included fill and drain hoses and Quick Connect sink adapter.

Water level - the proper amount of water for the fabric type. Temperature - range of temperatures allowed for a chosen fabric type. Tumble Action Time & Speed - how long the laundry is tumbled and at how many revolutions per minute. Soak Time - how long the laundry soaks in the solution of water and detergent.

Rinses - number of rinses and amount of water necessary for each specific load.

When the air expands it creates pressure inside the drum. The pressure forces the detergent into &amp; through the fabric about 100 times faster than you could by hand or machine.Does it really work?Yes. The loads come out exactly as clean as with a conventional washing machine. It has won many awards at trade shows, with the most prestigious one being the silver medal awarded to the portable washing machine at the IMPEX Invention Show in the US. The product has been purchased by several hundred thousand people since its invention.How does it rinse?There are two ways you can rinse the clothes:1.By Machine. After draining the grey water with the detachable drain spout, leave the clothes in the washer and fill with clean cold water. Replace the pressure lid, tighten and turn the machine for about 30 seconds. Drain and wring dry.2.By Hand. Fill the sink or basin with clean water.

{"text": "Equator Advanced Appliances pioneered the development of the horizontal smooth drum washing machine concept. The stainless steel drum cycles so many rotations left and then right gently passing and tumbling clothes through the wash water. This is distinctly different from the turbulent agitator action found in conventional washers. This smooth-wash feature greatly reduces the wear and tear on clothes that is often caused by the back and forth action of the standard agitator machines. Standard washing machines have a final spin cycle at about 500 RPM. Our galaxy machine revs up to over a 1000 RPM. This offers the advantage of more thoroughly spun clothes removing more water-which means less use of energy in the clothes dryer. Specifications:.

{"text": "The revolutionary cyclonic action drying technology, built-in water heater, and unrivaled settings customization are just a few of the features that combine to make the EdgeStar 2.0 Cu. Ft. Ventless Combo Washer/Dryer (CWD1510W) one of the most versatile and efficient combination washer/dryer units available. Using ventless condensation drying methods like many other combo washer/dryers, the EdgeStar CWD1510W stands apart by employing the use of unique cyclonic action drying technology. When drying, air is forced through the condensing chamber in a cyclonic pattern that helps better circulate air within the space, allowing the machine to remove moisture from the chamber with unmatched efficiency. While other machines simply tumble the load, the EdgeStar combo washer/dryer takes it a step further by infusing higher velocity airflow to speed up the drying process, meaning less waiting and less wrinkles. The condensation drying method takes longer than the traditional forced air drying method and therefore the combined wash and dry times of a load will be longer than that of a traditional washer and dryer.\nThis unit features an easy-to-use, front-mounted control panel with an intuitive dial/push-button control interface. You can choose from a virtually limitless list of customizable settings for every load type. Additionally, you can adjust the spin time up to a maximum of 9 minutes to achieve the highest water extraction levels.\nThe tub is constructed from high-quality polyurethane to keep noise and heat radiation to a minimum. The entire cabinet has a width and depth of about 24\", making it ideal for built-in installation and use in spaces with limited room. The use of a standard 115-volt household electrical plug allows you to use it for virtually any application with sufficient space, a water faucet, and a power outlet.", "labels": [[122, 123, "ENERGY_EFFICIENCY"], [169, 177, "ORG"], [190, 217, "ORG"], [229, 232, "CARDINAL"], [395, 403, "ORG"], [553, 554, "ENERGY_EFFICIENCY"], [755, 763, "ORG"], [792, 793, "ENERGY_EFFICIENCY"], [1054, 1055, "ENERGY_EFFICIENCY"], [1089, 1090, "ENERGY_EFFICIENCY"], [1258, 1259, "ENERGY_EFFICIENCY"], [1380, 1381, "ENERGY_EFFICIENCY"], [1393, 1402, "TIME"], [1541, 1542, "ENERGY_EFFICIENCY"], [1575, 1576, "ENERGY_EFFICIENCY"], [1602, 1604, "CARDINAL"], [1697, 1698, "ENERGY_EFFICIENCY"], [1817, 1818, "ENERGY_EFFICIENCY"], [1837, 1838, "ENERGY_EFFICIENCY"]]}

{"text": "If you are not sure if this part will work for your washer please contact me with your model number and i will check for you. \n\nIf the bearing and seal set you need is not in my amazon store please contact me.\n\nAll of my bearing sets have ABEC 5* grade ball bearings. My bearings are high speed electric motor grade bearings. The same quality bearings I have been using in my own business here in Portland for the past 6 years without any issues. That is why I have stayed with them. I have personally installed over 500 of these bearing and seal sets myself.\n\nThe fastest washer out there spins at 1500 RPM and my bearings and seals are rated for more than 6 times that speed and load. The smallest bearings I use are rated for 1740 LBS and the bigger bearings go up to over 4700 LBS. That's more weight than a Minivan.\n\nAs for my seals, I buy them from Taiwan, Germany, and Japan depending on the size and availability. (USA made seals are not available in these sizes) All my seals are high quality, fully sprung, double lip seals and are the same ones I have been using for 6 years on my own machines.\n\nAnd please don't forget...... I give a 5 YEAR WARRANTY and UNLIMITED TECH SUPPORT.\n\nThings to know about ABEC ratings:\n\n1) Bearings not conforming to at least ABEC 1 can not be classified as precision bearings as their tolerances are too loose.\n\n2)Lower ABEC grades are intended for applications such as mechanical hobbies, skates, skateboards, fishing reels, and alike.\n\n3)Mid-range grades (ABEC 5) are intended for applications such as vehicles, electric motors and industrial machinery. The maximum allowable tolerance on these bearings is 0.0035 mm.  These is the ones I sell.\n\n4) High grade bearings are intended for precision applications like aircraft instruments, jet engines, or surgical equipment. These can often cost many hundreds of dollars each.\n\n*(ABEC)-Annular Bearing Engineering Committee.
